A brief biography of yourself:

My name is **bold** and work at *italic* and do `code`

~~Sometimes you want numbered lists:~~

1. One
  * 1a
  * 1b 
2. Two
  - 2a
  - 2b
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this


If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

# LEVEL 1 

## level 2  

### level 3 

###### level 6 (lowest)


~~This is a block quote:~~

> abcdefg
> - captain ABC


~~This is how you incorporate codes:~~
``` 
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```


~~Extras~~

If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @bdong-CLS â€”work hard play hard! 


But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji! :+1:
